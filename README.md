# ST2-analysis
A collection of scripts to analyze the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) dataset produced in project [IEA EBC Annex 86](https://annex86.iea-ebc.org/) within subtask 2 (ST2). They are intended to be used on IAQ datasets standardized according to IEA EBC Annex 86 guidelines and/or produced with the R package [annex](https://github.com/IEA-EBC-Annex86/annex) developed within this project.
The dataset produced during the Annex 86 project is available for download in a [Zenodo repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14917724).
